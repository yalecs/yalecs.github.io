# Future Additions to the Website

Hey y/cs website builders! Here's a list of things to be implemented at some point, in no particular order

Please add anything you think of, and make sure to keep this list up-to-date as you complete things!

- Communities page (y/cs communities tbd)
- Carousel on the home page of all the products, preferably hyper-animated
- custom font: Roboto? Github-Mono?
- Design a more pleasing y/cs logo to go in the top right
  - Maybe to fit in with the gradient background logo design, have an orange-pink or purple-pink y/cs gradient behind the y/cs? If you go with this, animate it like a button
- Redesign the products page
- Redesign the events page
- Catalyst program page
- Make a banner component that lasts for a fixed amount of time (on the days-weeks scale), and is easy to implement.
  - Then, every time there is some big news, e.g. a new product is released or applications are open, we can set up the banner very easily
  - Ideally this would be reusable across most/all other products
- Redesign join page's timeline
- secrets! A bunch of fun secrets throughout the website. Here are some random
  - console.log hidden game
  - scrolling past the bottom really fast (there's a bounce animation) reveals something
  - some sort of puzzle that if people solve it, they get immediate admission into the club (until it becomes frequently solved)
  - hidden buttons that trigger wacky particle effects using tsparticles
- Improve the load time for the network particlesâ€”if you throttle the network speed and disable cache, you'll see that it takes a really long time sometimes for the particles to load in. This intuitively should not be resource intensive, so making it faster should be doable
- Make an internal list of things in the repo that consists of parts of the website that need to be regularly updated (team photos, dev products, banners, front page stats, sponsors, etc.)
- Dive into SEO
  - make "ycs" associated with the website (y/cs is, but searching yale ycs won't get anything)
- Google search analytics
- Redesign the sponsors component
- Make a sponsorship page or some sort of clear way for potential sponsors to get in touch, more than just the footer
- Redesign the about page and especially rewrite it
- Add a bunch of y/cs photos to the about and events pages
- The mobile hamburger menu flickers in after 0.01 seconds on phone, but you can tell. It looks a little glitchy
- Have the navigation bar underline the page you're currently on (if you're not on the home page)
- Currently the non-mobile navigation bar links have an animation from left to right. Change the animation such that if your mouse is moving left, it goes from right-to-left, and if it's movving right it goes from left-to-right
- Fade the network particles at their edges so they don't abruptly cut out
- Add github/linkedin/personal website icon-links to the people on the team page
- Explain the page structure, nextjs, vercel, and cloudflare on the readme
- Add more personality! The &lt;About Us /&gt; type of headers are a good start
- Find some way to ensure people working on the project are actually using eslint
- Fix the require imports in generalproduct screens to use nextjs images correctly
- fix logo on phone size screen
- update images for all projects and get higher-quality images
