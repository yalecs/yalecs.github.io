        <br></br>
        Indicate which divisions or teams you are interested in joining, share a
        bit about yourself, and why you're interested in joining y/cs.

        <br></br>
        For those applying for technical roles, we have a technical interview.
        <br /> <br />
        Those applying for product teams are evaluated on their ability to
        operate the tools/skills used to build the products. <br /> <br />
        We don't expect everyone to come to Yale knowing how to use these
        tools/skills, which is why we have beginner <strong>
          Cataylst
        </strong>{" "}
        programs designed to teach them to you! Those applying for beginner
        programs are evaluated on their ability/willingness to learn new
        technical concepts in a take-home challenge, with lots of office hour
        opportunities to help you complete it.
        <br /> <br />
        For those applying for non-technical roles (design, events, outreach),
        we do a short, non-technical interview.

        <br></br>
        <span className="font-bold">3. Team Placement</span>

        Based on your written application and interview you are placed on a y/cs
        team, as space permits.
